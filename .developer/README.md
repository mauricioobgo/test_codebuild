This directory stores developer-specific data for the dbt container, such as bash command history.
You may also set up your own bash aliases and other conveniences by creating a `bashrc` file (no `.`)
that will be sourced each time the container is started. Don't get fancy to the point where your
docker shell experience may end up behaving substantially different than other developers.
